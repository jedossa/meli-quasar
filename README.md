# Code Challenge: OperaciÃ³n Fuego de Quasar

## Architectural style and Code design choices

This project is bounded and heavily inspired by the hexagonal architecture -ports and adapters- and implementing 
[tagless final encoding](http://okmij.org/ftp/tagless-final/course/lecture.pdf) to achieved responsibility segregation,
inversion of control and emergent behavior; leading to maintainable, predictable, highly composable and orthogonal program.

In this project algebras are pure functions, with a single responsibility, that compose into repositories, services or validators and the last ones
compose into modules; modules compose into the main program. All the commitments in regards underlying effects, such as Streams or Futures,
are deferred to the main program allowing to constrain and inject dependency capabilities. 

As we can assume that parsing errors won't happen and the domain is quite anemic; the domain model contains only 
plain entities and values objects without any significant creation logic.

## Getting Started

Instructions to run the code on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Please install [sbt: The interactive build tool](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) from [here](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)
in order to build, compile, test and run the code:

For Linux (deb)
```
echo "deb https://dl.bintray.com/sbt/debian /" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list
curl -sL "https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x2EE0EA64E40A89B84B2DF73499E82A75642AC823" | sudo apt-key add
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sbt
```
For Linux (rpm)
```
curl https://bintray.com/sbt/rpm/rpm > bintray-sbt-rpm.repo
sudo mv bintray-sbt-rpm.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/
sudo yum install sbt
```

## Building

### From sources

Run `sbt stage`, this will create a launcher at `http/target/universal/stage/bin/quasar-http`.

### Docker image

Run `sbt docker:publishLocal`, this will pull `openjdk:jre-alpine` and build `quasar-http:0.0.1` images.
You can check it out running `docker images`.

## Running

HTTP is going to run at port `8080`

### From sbt

You can run the code directly from sbt-shell typing `sbt` and then `http/run`.

### From launcher

After running `sbt stage`, you can run the program as fallows:

```
./http/target/universal/stage/bin/quasar-http
```

### From a docker container

If you already created `quasar-http:0.0.1` image using `sbt docker:publishLocal`, you can run it in the interactive mode:

```
docker run -i quasar-http:0.0.1 -P
```

## Running the tests

All testing data is generated by [ScalaCheck](https://www.scalacheck.org/), a library used for automated property-based testing of Scala or Java programs.

### Unit tests

Unit tests code is under `core/src/test`. To run them use `sbt test`.

### Integration tests

Integration tests code is under `console/src/it`. To run them use `sbt it`.

### Coverage report

Run `sbt coverageAgg` to generate an aggregated report for unit and integration tests.

The generated report will be at `target/scala-2.13/scoverage-report/index.html`

```
Statement coverage.: 98.30%
Branch coverage....: 100.00%
```
